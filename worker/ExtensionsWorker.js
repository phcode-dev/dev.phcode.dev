// @INCLUDE_IN_API_DOCS
/**
 * This is a generic web worker that is available for use by extensions to offload extension related tasks. This
 * should only be used for performing small compute tasks and should not be used for long-running compute tasks.
 *
 * * Extensions are advised to use [worker/IndexingWorker](IndexingWorker-API) if they are performing large number of
 *   file operations to utilize the file cache.
 * * Extensions performing large compute tasks should create their own worker and may use easy util methods in
 *   [worker/WorkerComm](WorkerComm-API) to communicate with the web worker.
 *
 * ## Import
 * ```js
 * // usage within extensions:
 * const ExtensionsWorker = brackets.getModule("worker/ExtensionsWorker");
 * ```
 * ## Extending the ExtensionsWorker
 * You can add your own custom scripts to the ExtensionsWorker by following the below example. Suppose you have an
 * extension folder with the following structure:
 * ```
 * myExtensionFolder
 * │  my_worker.js // the script that you need to attach to the web worker
 * │  main.js
 * ```
 * In `main.js` extension module, we can import `my_worker.js` script into `ExtensionsWorker` by:
 * ```js
 * let ExtensionUtils = brackets.getModule("utils/ExtensionUtils");
 * let workerPath = ExtensionUtils.getModulePath(module, "my_worker.js")
 * ExtensionsWorker.loadScriptInWorker(workerPath);
 * ```
 *
 * Once the worker script is loaded with the above step:
 * * Phoenix can communicate with worker using the `IndexingWorker` reference in Phoenix.
 * * Worker can communicate with Phoenix with the global `WorkerComm` reference within the Indexing worker.
 * All utility methods in module [worker/WorkerComm](WorkerComm-API) can be used for worker communication.
 *
 * A global constant `Phoenix.baseURL` is available in the worker context to get the base url from which phoenix was
 * launched.
 *
 * NB: You can use all util methods available in `worker/WorkerComm` as `ExtensionsWorker` internally uses `WorkerComm`
 * to communicate with the underlying worker thread.
 *
 * @module worker/ExtensionsWorker

     * To communicate between the ExtensionsWorker and Phoenix, the following methods are available:
     * `loadScriptInWorker`, `execPeer`, `setExecHandler`, `triggerPeer` and other APIs described
     * in module `worker/WorkerComm`.
     * The above methods can be used with either `ExtensionsWorker` reference within Phoenix
     * or the global `WorkerComm` reference within the Indexing worker. (See example below.)
     *
     * See [worker/WorkerComm](WorkerComm-API) for detailed API docs.

     * @example <caption>To Execute a named function `extensionName.sayHello` in the worker from phoenix</caption>
     * // in my_worker.js. It is a good practice to prefix your `[extensionName]`
     * // to exec handler to prevent name collisions with other extensions.
     * WorkerComm.setExecHandler("extensionName.sayHello", (arg)=>{
     *     console.log("hello from worker ", arg); // prints "hello from worker phoenix"
     *     return "Hello Phoenix";
